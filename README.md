# React intern Take-a-home assignment

Hey there, glad you made this far. The task at hand is a take away assignment which you'll have to complete as per the instructions given to you via mail or any other form of contact.


So here is the scenario,

### Scenario

Your grandmother has dimentia and she has a lot of delicious recipe she wanted to save before she forgets everything. So she being a `senior` react developer (pun intended) decided to create an app to store all her recipes. But unfortunately she wasn't agile enough, and forget how to code. So with you being ambitious grandchild with react skills at hand is tasked to fix the app for her.

### Architecure

- Home page
  - The home page of the app is where the recipes are listed
  - Each card shows an overview of a recipe, upon clicked it shows the whole content
  - You can delete or archive recipes

- Create page
  - In create page you have a form to upload recipes

- archive page
  - here archived recipes appear which can be unarchived or deleted

---
  This is the intended application pretty straight forward for the sake of not making it complicated, you can keep the data in the memory.

## Missing features

> You are tasked to complete the said features

1. **Create new recipe**, should be able to add new recipes with following information like `Recipe title, Description, Ingredient list` you can find the data in the source code and the data types. The feature is half done you'll have to implement the rest.
2. **Delete feature**, should have the ability to delete each recipe from the home page
3. **Search**, when the data gets larger it need to be queried.
4. **Pagination** , you don't want the entire data all at once so paginate
5. **Archives**, The archive should be a page itself, accessed via nav bar. Arichvial should happen from home page, unarchive and deletion must be implemented
6. **Popups,alerts,fallbacks** are needed to be added as per need, which you have to identify.

NOTE:

- You can add more features but no try not to overcomplicate like for example :
 `` Using an ai agent that adds recipe which is connected to grandma's IOT wearable mic gets feedback from microphone attached to it while grandma lists all the recipe out``.
 We don't need that. Just keep it simple .

 - Good Design is appreciated like colors , use of components , stylings etc,... still keep it simple.

 ## Instruction regarding submission

4. After task completion create a screen record of explaining features you have implemented and walking through it.

 ### Important
In the repo you'll find a folder named ``component/ui`` do not edit it as it holds all the shadcn components.
